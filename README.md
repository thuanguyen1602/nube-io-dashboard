# Nube iO Dashboard

Initial start for the Nube iO Dashboard Web Application.
Based off the [Ant Design Pro UI framework](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro).

In addition to Ant Design Pro, we are also using JSON Server to run a fake REST API for storing the layouts and config of [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout).

## Install & Run
`npm install`<br />
`npm run json-server`<br />
`npm start`<br />

_Note: in order to start JSON Server and the development server, you may need to use __sudo___
