# Nube iO Dashboard

Initial start for the Nube iO Dashboard Web Application.
Based off the [Ant Design Pro UI framework](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro).

In addition to Ant Design Pro, we are also using JSON Server to run a fake REST API for storing the layouts and config of [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout).

## Install & Run
`npm install`
`npm run json-server`
`npm start`

_Note: to start both the back-end and front-end you may need to use sudo_
